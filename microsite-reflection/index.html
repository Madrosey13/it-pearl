    <h1> Microsite Reflection Assignment - Madison Young</h1>
    <h3><a href="../microsite-project/index.html">Site can be found here</a> </h3>
    </header>
<p>The feed back that I recived when doing my project were the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Original header colors too contrasting</li>
        <li>Fix typography errors</li>
        <li>Add accent colors to the site</li>
        <li>Add images to the site</li>
        <li>Add spacing between images and image captions</li>
    </ul>
<p>Developing the site was a challenge in itself. There were times were I developed decision paralysis just trying to figure out what I wanted to add to the site. But in the end, I think I was able to put those changes into my site to make it look somewhat presentable.</p>
<p>Where I went well was the organiziation of information HTML wise and the design aspect of the site. The places where I could improve was the javascript aspect of the assignment, with the weather assignment, for I am not very good with javascript. I would also like to work on CSS grid, flex-box, and float a bit more, since there are still problems I would like to take care of.</p>
<p>With the issues that the reviewer identified, I agreed with them. At that point, I was feeling burntout with the project and just haphazardly threw a bunch of things together. While I was able to finish this project, I still felt very unhappy with the final product. But I guess that what learning is about, learning from your mistakes and knowing more for the future.</p>
