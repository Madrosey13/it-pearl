    <h1> Microsite Reflection Assignment - Madison Young</h1>
    <h3><a href="../microsite-project/index.html">Site can be found here</a> </h3>
    </header>
<p>The feed back that I recived when doing my project were the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Original header colors too contrasting</li>
        <li>Fix typography errors</li>
        <li>Add accent colors to the site</li>
        <li>Add images to the site</li>
        <li>Add spacing between images and image captions</li>
    </ul>
<p>Developing the site was a challenge in itself. There were times were I developed decision paralysis just trying to figure out what I wanted to add to the site. But in the end, I think I was able to put those changes into my site to make it look somewhat presentable.</p>
<p>Where I went well was the organiziation of information HTML wise and the design aspect of the site. </p>
